# üåê **Playwright Automation Suite: Your All-in-One Web Testing and Automation Framework** üöÄ

## **Overview**
Welcome to the **Playwright Automation Suite**, a powerful and modular framework designed to simplify web automation and testing tasks. This project leverages the capabilities of the **Playwright** library to perform a wide range of web-based operations, from login automation to advanced data scraping, multi-tab handling, and performance testing.

Whether you're a developer, QA engineer, or enthusiast looking to automate repetitive tasks or test web applications, this suite provides all the tools you need(though it is open to updates).

## **Features**
This repository is organized into **three modular scripts**, each focusing on specific aspects of web automation:

### **Script 1: Core Automation Tasks**
- Launch and manage browser sessions (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
- Automate login workflows with multi-step authentication.
- Fill and submit web forms with dynamic data.
- Perform advanced mouse and keyboard interactions.
- Log errors and capture screenshots for debugging.

### **Script 2: Data Operations and Performance Testing**
- Scrape structured data from web pages (e.g., tables, lists).
- Automate file uploads and downloads.
- Analyze and log page performance metrics (e.g., load times, network requests).
- Reuse session cookies for seamless navigation.

### **Script 3: Advanced Web Interactions**
- Automate link clicks and handle navigation workflows.
- Solve captchas (integrate third-party services as needed).
- Manage multi-tab browsing and perform operations in each tab.
- Spoof user-agent strings for testing different devices or locations.
- Implement intelligent wait strategies for dynamic content.
